This is a simple horizontal Final Fantasy XIV damage meter [overlay](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin) to show party DPS based on [this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6q41r3/what_act_overlay_is_this_snipped_off_of_a_stream/).

![Horizontal overlay by https://www.twitch.tv/yuu_tayuun](https://i.redd.it/l1vfkfd2dccz.png "Horizontal Overlay by https://www.twitch.tv/yuu_tayuun")

It's based of the amazing work [of this repo](https://github.com/billyvg/OverlayPlugin-themes) that tries to compile a whole bunch of [Overlay](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin) themes together. Thanks to its repo's `testing.js` file (and [/u/rdmty](https://www.reddit.com/user/rdmty)), I was able to mock the data that ACT throws and built this theme.

## Example setup
This is how it should be showing for you after setup
![Horizoverlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/example.jpg "Horizoverlay")

Also check [this other example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/example2.jpg) without the mock data.

## Install
1. Please, be sure you are running version 0.3.3.13 or higher of hibiyasleep Overlay plugin: https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases | [Version x64](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases/download/0.3.3.13/OverlayPlugin-0.3.3.13-x64-full.zip) | [Version x86](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases/download/0.3.3.13/OverlayPlugin-0.3.3.13-x86-full.zip) |

2. Just paste this url into the overlay's url field:
`https://bsides.github.io/horizoverlay/`

3. You need to grab and resize the overlay and hit a mob to have data so it shows anything.

4. You should look at something like this: ![No Data Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/no-data.png)

5. From version 2 onwards, you can now right click anywhere the overlay to open a config menu:
![Config Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/config-window.png)

6. Test the options yourself! Here are some examples:
![Config Color Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/config-default-totaldps.png)
![Config Color By Role](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsides/horizoverlay/master/screenshots/config-byrole.png)

Ispired by [this overlay](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/kagerou).

## Usage
It'll show the name, class and DPS of players in your party. Resize the overlay window ~~will make its items bigger/wider~~ -> I've set the width to a max-width or else with less people in the party it'd look too wide! Adjust the window so it fits everyone in your party, like 50-60% of your screen width.

The order of the items, from left to right, is based on the amount of damage given by the player so sometimes it's not the higher dps.

I made it to fit the screen [like the example in the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6q41r3/what_act_overlay_is_this_snipped_off_of_a_stream/) (I even worked with [this screenshot](https://puu.sh/x4Qhi/dcce1de30b.jpg) behind the overlay).

## Suggestion, bug report, critic, general questions, etc
Please, [open an issue](https://github.com/bsides/horizoverlay/issues). Also don't forget to search if it's alerady down here in the known issue section ;)

If you want to contact me in game, I currently play in Cactuar server as Guru Clef

## Next steps
* Make it configurable ([look at this!](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/kagerou))
* About the above, maybe start with the things that will be shown: name, position, DPS, damage, etc.

## Known issues
Some files aren't used in this theme but I left here to make it more customizeable in the future: `CombatantCompact.js` and `Combatant.js`. In theory, `Encounter.js` isn't used either (but its component is used to keep semantics).

## Other details
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
